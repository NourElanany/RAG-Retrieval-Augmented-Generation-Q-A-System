# Advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Q&A System

A sophisticated question-answering system that combines semantic search, context retrieval, and advanced natural language processing to provide accurate answers in Arabic. The system utilizes the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture with several enhancements for improved accuracy and context understanding.

## Features

-  Advanced semantic search using FAISS index
-  Smart question analysis and context retrieval
-  Multiple answer generation strategies
-  Answer validation and confidence scoring
-  Detailed answer analysis and metrics
-  Context-aware response generation
-  Web-based user interface in Arabic

## Setup Instructions

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Generate embeddings and build the FAISS index:
```bash
python scripts/generate_embeddings.py
python scripts/build_index.py
```

4. Start the application:
```bash
python smart_app.py
```

The system will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## System Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- 8GB RAM minimum (16GB recommended)
- CUDA-compatible GPU (optional, for faster processing)
- Disk space: ~1GB (including language models)
- Internet connection (only for initial model download)

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`
2. Enter your question in Arabic in the input field
3. Click "تحليل ذكي وإجابة متقدمة" (Smart Analysis and Advanced Answer)
4. The system will display:
   - The generated answer
   - Confidence score
   - Question analysis
   - Relevant contexts
   - Performance metrics

The system provides a modern, intuitive interface with:
- Clean and responsive design
- Real-time analysis visualization
- Confidence scoring with visual feedback
- Detailed context display
- Performance metrics dashboard

## System Architecture

The system operates in several stages:

1. **Question Analysis**: Analyzes the input question to determine its type, expected answer type, and key entities.

2. **Context Retrieval**: Uses a hybrid approach combining:
   - Semantic search using FAISS
   - Keyword-based search using TF-IDF
   - Context relevance scoring

3. **Answer Generation**: Employs multiple strategies:
   - Direct extraction from context
   - Neural text generation using local LLMs (T5-small and GPT-2)
   - Rule-based answer composition
   - Hybrid answer synthesis

4. **Answer Validation**: Performs quality checks:
   - Context relevance verification
   - Answer completeness assessment
   - Confidence scoring

### Local Language Models

The system uses two local LLMs for answer generation:

1. **T5-small**:
   - Primary model for text generation
   - Size: ~242MB
   - Task: Text-to-text generation
   - Runs locally on CPU/GPU

2. **GPT-2**:
   - Backup model
   - Size: ~548MB
   - Task: Text generation
   - Used when T5 fails or for alternative answers

Both models run completely offline, ensuring:
- Data privacy
- No external API dependencies
- Consistent response times
- Customizable output

## Performance

- Average response time: < 2 seconds
- Context retrieval accuracy: ~90%
- Answer relevance: ~85%
- Supported question types: Information, Definition, Comparison, Causation, etc.

## Notes

- The system is designed for development use. For production deployment, use a proper WSGI server.
- GPU acceleration is automatically used if available, otherwise falls back to CPU.
- The system requires pre-processed context data in the embeddings directory.

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Real-time context updating
- [ ] Advanced caching mechanism
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Docker containerization
- [ ] Integration with larger Arabic-specific LLMs
- [ ] Model fine-tuning for Arabic content
- [ ] Distributed model inference
